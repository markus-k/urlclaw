Ferris will make brain-sized short-URLs from your giant URLs!



## Running

Currently, urlclaw needs a Postgres database for storing short-URLs. See [Configuration](#configuration).

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables:

* `PORT`: Port to listen on for incoming http requests, defaults to `80`.
* `BIND_ADDR`: Address to bind to. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Database to connect to. Currently, only Postgres is supported. See [sqlx documentation](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/postgres/struct.PgConnectOptions.html).
